  Hey there! Nice to meet you.
</p>


My name is Amedeo Ceruti. I am a chemical engineer from Barcelona, Spain. I am currently studying at [TU Munich](https://www.tum.de/), Germany and working on my master thesis in collaboration with the Process Systems Engineering Chair, [SVT](https://www.maschinenbau.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Maschinenbau/Die-Fakultaet/Institute-und-Lehrstuehle/Uebersicht-aller-Institute/~dfoy/AVT-SVT/?lidx=1), of [RWTH Aachen Universtiy](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1).

My main interests are models of chemical processes: first-principle, data-driven or hybrid ones. Related topics which interest me are the optimization and application of these chemical processes towards more sustainable and circular production concepts. I enjoy playing water polo and reading in my free time. 

My main goal for the near future is working towards a PhD in a related topic and a more active engagement in selected communities.

### This website is currently under development!

I will be publishing some blogs about my current and past research, as well as other posts about unrelated topics which I am interested in, including essays on political topics.
